# Implementation Workflow Skills

A lightweight three-skill workflow for planning implementation work, executing plans, and reviewing implementation results.

The skills are intentionally independent. They share a small file-level convention but do not require a shared protocol skill.

## Skills

- `implementation-planning`: turn already-settled requirements and design into small implementation plans.
- `plan-implementation`: implement explicitly selected plans while preserving plan boundaries and recording results.
- `implementation-review`: add plan/result-specific review responsibilities on top of normal code review.

## Default document convention

When a repository has no established equivalent convention, use semantic work directories such as:

```text
docs/implementation/<work-name>/
├── index.md
├── plan.md
├── result.md     # created when an execution result exists
└── problem.md    # created only when replanning details are needed
```

Existing repository conventions take precedence when they express the same roles clearly.

Plan state is durable repository state, with these meanings:

- `planned`: the current plan is ready to be implemented when its dependencies are satisfied.
- `completed`: the current plan has been completed and its result recorded.
- `replan-required`: the current plan cannot be completed without changing its implementation boundary.

Derived transient states such as “ready”, “blocked”, or “in progress” do not need to be persisted.
